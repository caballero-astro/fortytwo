FORTYTWO: A Pulsar timing/Gravitational wave analysis software.
(v1.0 available)

Started by KJ Lee in C as SEDGE, since 2015 we evolved the code into FORTYTWO and it is now fully written in Python.

FORTYTWO can perform pulsar noise analysis and search for common signals such as gravitational waves, clock signals and Solar-system ephemeris signals. 
It uses Bayesian methods with Monte-Carlo samplers to estimate the probability distributions of pulsar-noise and common-noise/signal parameters. It also uses  frequentist methods, for example to estimate signal sensitivity curves or perform maximum-likelihood analyses.
