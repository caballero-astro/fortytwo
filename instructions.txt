Fortytwo v1.0: Pulsar timing/Gravitational wave analysis software.
 

# Code analysis capabilities:
----------------------------------

In terms of common-signal(CS)/GW analyses, it only includes Bayesian GWB libraries. Specifically:

- Power-law, broken power-law and free-spectrum searches for GWB, clock, dipolar signals
- Free ORF signals
- Model comparisons
- phase shifts

In terms of pulsar noise:
It can simultaneously fit:
- red noise,
- DM noise,
- scattering variation noise
- ”DM events” (only hard-coded cases for J1713+0747)
- global Efac

Before CS search, the timing residuals in bat_info files are assumed to have the pulsar uncorrelated white noise (EFAC+EQUAD) already implemented. ECORR handling is available in the next version, where all three parameters are handled together in the covariance matrix.

In terms of MC samplers, only PTMCMC is included.


# Code compatibility and use:
------------------------------------
The code is compatible with python3.10 and 3.12.
No installation is required. Simply copy the root directory Fortytwo in your python site-packages directory.

Use the .py exe files to configure and run the analysis. See the Examples directory.

In principle, on your terminal, you can run using 

taskset -c 2 python3 name_of_exe_file.py

taskset is convenient to use since the code uses PTMCMC which runs on a single core.
If you run the code on a HPC system, use the queuing system to preferably submit using one core.

# Code requirements:
--------------------------

python3.10+

important libraries
numpy, scipy, PTMCMCSampler, mpi4py, astropy

# Notes
----------

- Do not use method=QR in v1.0! It’s not finished/tested
