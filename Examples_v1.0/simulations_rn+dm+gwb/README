The examples use 6 pulsars with psrlist_6.txt to run relatively fast.
For a faster test you can use the psrlist_2.txt
For a full analysis, use all 25 pulsars with psrlist_25.txt
Otherwise, play around with any pulsar combination you want.

The _DE440.rn.par files contain the exact noise values injected.

EFACs were created with np.random.normal(1,0.02)

Remember that the pulasr EFACs are already applied on the residuals in the bat_info_DE440.txt - 
Therefore, if global EFACs are applied in the common signal analysis, they should return distributions around 1.
Since the injected values are close to 1 anyway, the results will differ by a rather small amount with/without fitting global efacs.

Power-law GWB injected with parametrs Amp=4.5e-15, gamma=4.33
