The simulated data are ready to be used by FORTYTWO. 
Simulations made using libstempo.

In the currect version, FORTYTWO reads the data from ascii files. 
In particular:

** bat_info_DE440.txt : contains the timing residuals with pulsar white noise parameters (EFAC and EQUAD) already applied. Created with tempo2 general2 plugin. Columns are:
TOAs (BATs in MJD) , postfit residuals (sec), residual errors (usec) , obs. frequency (MHz), flags

** designmatrix_DE440.txt : the design matrix , created with tempo2 writeres plugin

** _DE440.rn.par : The par file, including the noise parameters (in temponest style)

** Also included are the original .par (_DE440.par) and .tim file, only for reference. They are not read by FORTYTWO. Future version will only need these two files and the necessary intermediate steps will be done in the code.

Examples: 

Two examples are provided:
1) simulations_rn+dm: fake 10-year data, with weekly observations at 3 frequencies  ( mjds made with np.arange(51544,55197,7) )
TOA error level at 1440,2600,400 MHz are 200, 300, 400 ns. efac=1

2) As above but with GWB injected. Small randomization in efacs.

See README files in each simulation directory for some details.
